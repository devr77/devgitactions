<p>Hello, hope you are enjoying the course so far :)</p><p>I forgot to mention in the previous lecture that the checkout action can also take some inputs as well. You can for instance change the commit that you are checking-out to, override the authentication token with another one, choose the fetch depth and more.</p><p>You can check the rest of the options here: <a href="https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage</a></p>
